AC584 Assignment - Quarto

This assignment involved using rstudio to display visual images about data given to us from the Unicef data files in excel spreadsheets. We had to analyse different excel files and create four different data visualisations.
I created a world map, a time series, a bar chart and a scatter plot.
These graphs displayed information on life expectancy population and math proficiency level of primary school students.
